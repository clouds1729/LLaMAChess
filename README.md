# ‚ôüÔ∏è LLaMAChess

**Talk chess with a local LLaMA model.**  
Set up positions, ask questions, and get analysis ‚Äî no API keys, no internet required.

---

## üß† What It Does

LLaMAChess is a browser-based chess interface that lets you:

- Play against a simple JavaScript chess engine (minimax + evaluation tables)
- Load popular openings or custom board positions
- Ask natural-language questions about the current board  
  _e.g. ‚ÄúIs white threatening anything?‚Äù_

It combines `chess.js`, `chessboard.js`, and a **locally hosted** LLaMA 2 model served via FastAPI and `llama-cpp-python`.

---

## üë• Who It's For

- Chess learners who want _more than Stockfish lines_
- People who want private, offline analysis
- Hackers who want to integrate LLMs into traditional games

---

## üí° Motivation

We wanted to bridge the gap between **game engines** and **language models** ‚Äî  
using an LLM not to _play_ chess, but to _explain_ it.

Instead of just showing moves, we let users ask:

- **Why** a move is good  
- **What‚Äôs** happening on the board  
- **Who‚Äôs** winning

All from the browser, no cloud required.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- üß† `llama-cpp-python` loads a `.gguf` LLaMA model and exposes a FastAPI `/ask` endpoint  
- üß© The frontend captures the current FEN + user question and sends it to the backend  
- üó£Ô∏è The model replies in plain English, and we show it in the UI

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Python 3.9+ and a `.gguf` LLaMA model (7B recommended)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LLaMAChess.git
```

### 2. Set up the backend

```bash
cd LLaMAChess/backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
# or
source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Got you ‚Äî here‚Äôs a more explicit and copy-paste-ready section for your `README.md`, with a direct link and clearer formatting:

### üì¶ 3. Add the Model (Not Included)

The LLaMA model file is **not included** in this repository due to its size.

To run the backend, you‚Äôll need to:

1. **Download a `.gguf` model file** from Hugging Face:  
   üëâ [LLaMA 2 7B Chat GGUF (q4_K_M)](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF/resolve/main/llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf)

2. **Ensure the file size is over 3GB** (this confirms it's the full model).

3. Rename the file to:

   ```
   llama.gguf
   ```

4. Move it into your project folder:

   ```
   backend/models/llama.gguf
   ```

5. Then start the backend server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

---


### 4. Run the backend server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 5. Serve the frontend

In another terminal:

```bash
cd LLaMAChess
python -m http.server 5500
```

### 6. Open the app

Go to:

```
http://localhost:5500/index.html
```
