# ♟️ LLaMAChess

**Talk chess with a local LLaMA model.**  
Set up positions, ask questions, and get analysis — no API keys, no internet required.

---

## 🧠 What It Does

LLaMAChess is a browser-based chess interface that lets you:

- Play against a simple JavaScript chess engine (minimax + evaluation tables)
- Load popular openings or custom board positions
- Ask natural-language questions about the current board  
  _e.g. “Is white threatening anything?”_

It combines `chess.js`, `chessboard.js`, and a **locally hosted** LLaMA 2 model served via FastAPI and `llama-cpp-python`.

---

## 👥 Who It's For

- Chess learners who want _more than Stockfish lines_
- People who want private, offline analysis
- Hackers who want to integrate LLMs into traditional games

---

## 💡 Motivation

We wanted to bridge the gap between **game engines** and **language models** —  
using an LLM not to _play_ chess, but to _explain_ it.

Instead of just showing moves, we let users ask:

- **Why** a move is good  
- **What’s** happening on the board  
- **Who’s** winning

All from the browser, no cloud required.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- 🧠 `llama-cpp-python` loads a `.gguf` LLaMA model and exposes a FastAPI `/ask` endpoint  
- 🧩 The frontend captures the current FEN + user question and sends it to the backend  
- 🗣️ The model replies in plain English, and we show it in the UI

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

> ⚠️ Requires Python 3.9+ and a `.gguf` LLaMA model (7B recommended)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LLaMAChess.git
```

### 2. Set up the backend

```bash
cd LLaMAChess/backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
# or
source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add model

Download a `.gguf` model (e.g. LLaMA 2 7B) and place it in:

```
backend/models/llama.gguf
```

### 4. Run the backend server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 5. Serve the frontend

In another terminal:

```bash
cd LLaMAChess
python -m http.server 5500
```

### 6. Open the app

Go to:

```
http://localhost:5500/index.html
```
